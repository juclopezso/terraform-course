Terraform uses a **declarative language**

- **Declarative Language:** Declarative languages, also called nonprocedural or very high level, are programming languages in which (ideally) a program specifies what is to be done rather than how to do it.
    - Common declarative languages include those of database query languages (e.g., SQL, XQuery), regular expressions, logic programming (e.g. Prolog, Datalog, answer set programming), functional programming, and configuration management systems.

Terraform is **Plugable** by design 

- It’s made up of modules and resources, supports various cloud **providers**
- Terraform can manage **IaaS** (AWS, Azure, etc), **PaaS** (Cloud Foundry, etc.), and **SaaS** (Cloudflare, etc.)
